### **Stock Correlation Networks: A Network Analysis of the Financial Market**

## TODO:
* Give nodes ground-truth communities, based on the Wikipedia table/sector
* We wont work with negative correlations (simpler explainability)
* Community detection for different thresholds
* Comparison of detected communities to ground-truth sectors
* Comparison of different time periods: calm times vs crisis (before 2008 vs 2008, before Trump vs during Trump) - length of time periods should probably be same
* Explanation of small part of correlation matrix into report
* Explanation of different communities during different time periods


##  Project Work
* Henri: Community detection & visualization
* Riccardo: Centrality measure + Time Windows analysis (do centrality measures actually make sense for this, though?)
* Ondra: Theory, explanations, math of correlations
